# lwjgl-altitude

Compatibility layer between LWJGL2 (legacy) and LWJGL3, tuned for the video game [Altitude](https://altitudegame.com/) (
also legacy, technologically). In particular, at least on modern drivers, the display management of vanilla Altitude is
horrible. Hopefully GLFW (used by LWJGL3) is better...
